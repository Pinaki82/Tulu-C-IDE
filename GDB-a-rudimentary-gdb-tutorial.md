# GDB Debugging Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

The GNU Debugger (GDB) is a powerful debugging tool that helps developers analyze and fix problems in their programs. This tutorial covers essential aspects of using GDB, from basic setup to advanced debugging techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with GDB debugging, ensure you have:

- GDB installed on your system
- Basic understanding of C/C++ programming
- Access to a terminal/command line interface

## Compilation with Debugging Symbols

To effectively use GDB, programs must be compiled with debugging symbols. These symbols provide GDB with crucial information about the program's structure.

```bash
# Basic compilation with debug symbols
gcc -g program.c -o program

# Compilation with shared libraries
gcc -g program.c -o program -lsome_library
```

The `-g` flag tells the compiler to include debugging information in the executable. Without these symbols, GDB's functionality would be limited.

## Starting GDB

There are several ways to start GDB, depending on your needs:

### Basic Start

```bash
gdb program
```

### With Text User Interface (TUI)

```bash
gdb -tui program
```

The TUI mode provides a split-screen interface showing:

- Source code
- Command window
- Program output

### With Command Line Arguments

```bash
# Method 1 (recommended)
gdb --args program arg1 arg2 arg3

# Method 2 (with TUI)
gdb -tui --args program arg1 arg2 arg3
```

## Essential GDB Commands

Once inside GDB, you can use these fundamental commands:

### Program Execution Controls

- `run` or `r`: Start program execution
- `start`: Begin execution and break at main()
- `continue` or `c`: Continue execution
- `next` or `n`: Step over (execute next line)
- `step` or `s`: Step into (enter function calls)
- `finish`: Run until current function returns

### Breakpoint Management

- `break function_name`: Set breakpoint at function
- `break file:line`: Set breakpoint at specific line
- `info breakpoints`: List all breakpoints
- `delete breakpoint_number`: Remove specific breakpoint
- `disable breakpoint_number`: Temporarily disable breakpoint
- `enable breakpoint_number`: Re-enable disabled breakpoint

### Inspection Commands

- `print variable`: Display variable value
- `backtrace` or `bt`: Show call stack
- `info locals`: Display local variables
- `info args`: Show function arguments
- `whatis variable`: Show variable type

## Working with Shared Libraries

When debugging programs that use shared libraries (`.so` files on Linux or `.dll` files on Windows):

1. Compile with library linking:
   
   ```bash
   gcc -g program.c -o program -lsome_library
   ```

2. GDB automatically loads shared libraries during debugging

3. Verify loaded libraries:
   
   - Use "Modules" tab in TUI mode
   - Use `info shared` command

## TUI Mode Navigation

The Text User Interface provides several views:

### Key Bindings

- `F5`: Run/Continue program
- `F6`: View variables
- `F7`: Step into function
- `F8`: Step over function
- `F11`: Show backtrace

### Layout Controls

- `Ctrl-x a`: Toggle TUI mode
- `Ctrl-x 1`: Show single window
- `Ctrl-x 2`: Show two windows
- `Ctrl-L`: Refresh screen

## Best Practices

1. **Always Compile with Debug Symbols**
   
   - Use `-g` flag consistently
   - Keep source files accessible

2. **Set Strategic Breakpoints**
   
   - Place breakpoints at critical code sections
   - Use conditional breakpoints for complex scenarios

3. **Use TUI Mode for Better Visibility**
   
   - Helps track program flow
   - Shows source code context

4. **Inspect Variables Carefully**
   
   - Check variable values at key points
   - Watch for unexpected changes

5. **Handle Shared Libraries Properly**
   
   - Ensure proper linking during compilation
   - Verify library loading during debugging

## Advanced Features

### Watch Points

```bash
watch variable    # Break when variable changes
rwatch variable   # Break when variable is read
awatch variable   # Break on read or write
```

### Conditional Breakpoints

```bash
break file:line if condition
break function if argc > 1
```

### Examining Memory

```bash
x/nfu address    # Examine memory at address
# n = number of units
# f = format (x/d/u/o/t/a/c/s)
# u = unit size (b/h/w/g)
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Missing Debug Symbols**
   
   - Symptom: Limited debugging information
   - Solution: Recompile with `-g` flag

2. **Shared Library Not Found**
   
   - Symptom: Library loading errors
   - Solution: Check library path and linking

3. **Source Files Not Found**
   
   - Symptom: Cannot display source code
   - Solution: Ensure source files are in correct location

## Conclusion

GDB is a versatile debugging tool that becomes more powerful as you learn its features. Regular practice with small programs will help build proficiency. Remember to:

- Always compile with debug symbols
- Use TUI mode for better visualisation
- Set strategic breakpoints
- Pay attention to shared library handling
- Keep source files accessible

This understanding will make debugging more efficient and help resolve program issues more effectively.

# Advanced GDB Features: A Deep Dive

## Conditional Breakpoints

Conditional breakpoints allow you to pause program execution only when specific conditions are met. This is particularly useful when debugging loops, recursive functions, or situations where you want to examine the program state under particular circumstances.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
break location if condition
```

The `location` can be:

- A line number
- A function name
- A file:line combination

The `condition` can be any valid C expression that evaluates to true or false.

### Examples with Explanations

Let's look at some practical examples:

#### Example 1: Breaking on Array Index

```c
// Program code
for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    array[i] = process_data(i);
}

// GDB command
break 5 if i == 50
```

This breakpoint will only trigger when the loop variable `i` equals 50, allowing you to examine the program state at exactly the midpoint of the loop.

#### Example 2: Breaking on Value Condition

```c
struct User {
    int id;
    char* name;
    float balance;
};

void process_user(struct User* user) {
    // Process user data
}

// GDB command
break process_user if user->balance < 0
```

This breakpoint triggers only when processing users with negative balances, helpful for debugging account-related issues.

#### Example 3: Multiple Conditions

```c
void update_status(int status, char* message) {
    // Update system status
}

// GDB command
break update_status if status == 500 && message != 0
```

This breakpoint combines conditions to break only on error status (500) with non-null messages.

### Dynamic Condition Updates

You can modify breakpoint conditions during debugging:

```bash
# List breakpoints
info breakpoints

# Change condition of breakpoint 1
condition 1 new_condition

# Remove condition (makes breakpoint unconditional)
condition 1
```

## Examining Memory

Memory examination in GDB allows you to inspect raw memory contents, which is crucial for debugging pointer-related issues, buffer overflows, or understanding data structures at a low level.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
x/nfu address
```

Where:

- `n` = number of units to display
- `f` = display format
- `u` = unit size

### Format Specifiers (f)

- `x` = hexadecimal (default)
- `d` = decimal
- `u` = unsigned decimal
- `o` = octal
- `t` = binary
- `a` = address
- `c` = character
- `s` = string
- `i` = instruction

### Unit Sizes (u)

- `b` = byte (1 byte)
- `h` = halfword (2 bytes)
- `w` = word (4 bytes)
- `g` = giant word (8 bytes)

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Examining String Content

```c
char* message = "Hello, World!";

// GDB commands
# Print as string
x/s message
# Output: "Hello, World!"

# Print first 5 characters as bytes
x/5cb message
# Output: 72 'H'  101 'e'  108 'l'  108 'l'  111 'o'
```

#### Example 2: Examining Integer Array

```c
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// GDB commands
# Print 5 words in decimal
x/5dw numbers
# Output: 1  2  3  4  5

# Print 5 words in hex
x/5xw numbers
# Output: 0x00000001  0x00000002  0x00000003  0x00000004  0x00000005
```

#### Example 3: Examining Struct Memory Layout

```c
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
} point = {10, 20};

// GDB commands
# Examine struct memory
x/2dw &point
# Output: 10  20

# Examine byte by byte
x/8cb &point
# Shows individual bytes in memory
```

### Advanced Memory Examination Techniques

#### Following Pointers

```c
int* ptr = &value;

// GDB commands
# Print pointer address
x/a &ptr

# Print value at pointer
x/d ptr
```

#### Examining Memory Regions

```bash
# Examine 16 bytes starting at address
x/16xb address

# Examine as instructions
x/5i $pc  # Current instruction pointer
```

### Best Practices for Memory Examination

1. **Address Verification**
   Always verify addresses before examination:
   
   ```bash
   print &variable  # Get address
   x/nfu &variable  # Examine memory
   ```

2. **Unit Size Selection**
   Choose appropriate unit size for data type:
   
   - Use `b` for chars
   - Use `w` for ints
   - Use `g` for long longs/doubles

3. **Format Selection**
   Select format based on what you're examining:
   
   - Use `x` for raw memory viewing
   - Use `d` for numeric values
   - Use `s` for strings
   - Use `i` for instructions

### Common Use Cases

1. **Buffer Overflow Detection**
   
   ```bash
   # Examine memory before suspected overflow
   x/32xb buffer
   
   # Continue program
   continue
   
   # Re-examine to see changes
   x/32xb buffer
   ```

2. **String Manipulation Debugging**
   
   ```bash
   # View string content
   x/s string_ptr
   
   # View raw bytes
   x/16xb string_ptr
   ```

3. **Data Structure Investigation**
   
   ```bash
   # Examine struct layout
   x/nfu &struct_var
   
   # Follow pointer chain
   x/a pointer
   x/nfu *pointer
   ```

## Tips for Effective Usage

1. **Combining Features**
   Use conditional breakpoints with memory examination:
   
   ```bash
   break *address if *(int*)ptr == value
   commands
   x/nfu examination_address
   continue
   end
   ```

2. **Memory Watch Points**
   Set watchpoints on memory regions:
   
   ```bash
   watch *((int*)address)
   watch -location buffer  # Watch entire buffer
   ```

3. **Automated Memory Inspection**
   Create GDB scripts for repeated memory analysis:
   
   ```bash
   define inspect_buffer
   x/32xb buffer
   x/s buffer
   end
   ```

Remember that memory examination requires careful handling of addresses and understanding of data layout. Always verify addresses before examination to avoid crashes or misleading results.

Here are some key features:\n\n- **Start the program**: Click the \"Run\" button or press `F5`.\n- **Print a variable**: Use the \"Variables\" tab or press `F6`.\n- **Continue execution**: Use the \"Run\" button or press `F5`.\n- **Step into a function**: Use the \"Step\" button or press `F7`.\n- **Step over a function**: Use the \"Step Over\" button or press `F8`.\n- **Print current stack trace**: Use the \"Backtrace\" button or press `F11`.\n\n### Step 4: Example\nLet's walk through the same example as before, but now using the text user interface and passing command-line arguments:\n\nCompile the program:\n```bash\ngcc main.c -o main\n```\n\nRun GDB:\n```bash\ngdb --args main arg1 arg2 arg3\n```\n\nStart the program:\n- Click the \"Run\" button or press `F5`.\n\nPrint the value of `num`:\n- Click the \"Variables\" tab or press `F6`.\n\nContinue execution:\n- Click the \"Run\" button or press `F5`.\n\nYou should see the output:\n```\nNumber is: 10\n```\n\n### Step 5: Debugging\nIf you encounter an error, you can use GDB to step into functions and inspect variables. For example, if you have a function `add` that takes two arguments, you can step into it:\n- Click the \"Step\" button or press `F7`.\n\nPrint the values of the arguments:\n- Click the \"Variables\" tab or press `F6`.\n\nContinue execution:\n- Click the \"Run\" button or press `F5`.\n\n### Conclusion\nUsing the `--args` option with GDB ensures that the program receives the specified command-line arguments when it is executed. This is particularly useful when debugging programs that require specific arguments to run correctly. Practice by working on small projects to get comfortable with GDB's features.",
