system("COLOR 0A"); //Black Background + Light Green Text
Sets the default console foreground and background colors.

COLOR [attr]

  attr        Specifies color attribute of console output

Color attributes are specified by TWO hex digits -- the first
corresponds to the background; the second the foreground.  Each digit
can be any of the following values:

    0 = Black							  8 = Gray (Good but very light)
    1 = Blue	xxx						9 = Light Blue xxx
    2 = Green	yes						A = Light Green (Looks Good)
    3 = Aqua	yes						B = Light Aqua (Looks Good)
    4 = Red		xxx						C = Light Red (so so, light)
    5 = Purple	xxx					D = Light Purple (so so, light)
    6 = Yellow	yes					E = Light Yellow (Looks Good)
    7 = White (default console)			F = Bright White (very bright, Looks Good)

If no argument is given, this command restores the color to what it was
when CMD.EXE started.  This value either comes from the current console
window, the /T command line switch or from the DefaultColor registry
value.

The COLOR command sets ERRORLEVEL to 1 if an attempt is made to execute
the COLOR command with a foreground and background color that are the
same.

Example: "COLOR fc" produces light red on bright white
color
