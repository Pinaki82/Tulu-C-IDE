Generating Random Numbers 

 The key function in generating random numbers is; 

	int random (int n);

 which generates a random number in the range of 0 to n-1. For example; 

	y = random(100);

 y will be in the range of 0 though 99. 

 Note that if you run the following program, again and again, the same three random numbers will be generated. That is, TurboC always seeds the random number generator with the same starting number. 

 This feature is great for debugging. However, it would terrible if you were designing software for the gaming industry as everyone would know what numbers were going to come up. 

 Therefore, the function "randomize()" may be used to seed the random number generator with a number which is developed from the system clock, which of course, is always changing.
