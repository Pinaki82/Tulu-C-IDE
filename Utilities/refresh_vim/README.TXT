Vim can remember many things, such as the most recently opened files list,
command-line history,
tons of clipboard items copied, and many things.

If you want to refresh Vim, then you have to delete some files
in Vim's $HOME directory, or, simply your user account directory,
e.g., C:\Documents and Settings\(user account).

Open My computer, then at the address bar, type %userprofile% and click Go.
Put 'del_n_refresh.exe' there, create a shortcut to that app in your
start-menu folder if possible, or you may keep the shortcut anywhere you
prefer, e.g. Desktop.

Run the small program to delete some files created by Vim.
Now Vim is refreshed.
Vim keeps its history in some files in the user account folder.



NOTE: Do not unnecessarily refresh Vim. History in Vim comes in handy.
History saves your labour.
